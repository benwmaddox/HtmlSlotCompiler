# HtmlSlotCompiler: Language Implementation Comparison

## Overview
Three implementations of the HTML slot compiler: **C# (.NET)**, **Go**, and **Rust**. All compiled with optimization for production use.

---

## Executable Size

| Language | Size      | Build Type    | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Rust** | **1.5 MB** | Release (opt) | Smallest binary, using kuchiki for DOM manipulation |
| **C# (.NET)** | 5.4 MB | AOT Release   | Native AOT compilation with AngleSharp |
| **Go**   | 6.2 MB | Release       | Between Rust and .NET |

**Winner: Rust** - 76% smaller than Go, 72% smaller than .NET

---

## Startup Speed

| Language | Time   | Test Env |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Rust** | 29ms   | Real machine |
| **Go**   | 42ms   | Real machine |
| **C# (.NET)** | 56ms | Real machine (AOT) |

**Winner: Rust** - 31% faster than Go, 48% faster than .NET

---

## Build Time

| Language | Compile Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Go**   | ~2s        | Fastest incremental builds |
| **Rust** | ~33s       | First build includes dependency compilation |
| **C# (.NET)** | ~5s    | MSBuild with incremental caching |

**Winner: Go** - Blazing fast iteration

---

## Output Quality

All three produce identical correct HTML output when fully implemented. Current implementations:

- **C# (.NET)**: ‚úÖ Full slot merging, auto-normalization, asset copying, file hashing (AngleSharp)
- **Go**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial implementation (HTML parsing issues with goquery)
- **Rust**: ‚úÖ Full slot merging, proper DOM manipulation, asset copying, file hashing (kuchiki)

**Winner: Tie - C# & Rust** - Both produce correct, identical output

---

## Maintainability & Development Experience

| Aspect | C# | Go | Rust |
|--------|----|----|------|
| **Learning curve** | Moderate | Low | Steep (borrow checker) |
| **Error handling** | Good (exceptions) | Explicit (returns) | Excellent (Result type) |
| **Async/Concurrency** | Excellent (async/await) | Great (goroutines) | Good (tokio) |
| **HTML parsing** | Great (AngleSharp) | Good (goquery) | Excellent (scraper) |
| **Type safety** | Good (nullable reference types) | Limited | Excellent (strict) |

**Winner: Go** (lowest barrier to entry), **Rust** (most robust)

---

## Runtime Performance (Single Build)

```
Sample: 2 HTML pages

C# (.NET):   56ms total (native AOT)
Go:          42ms total
Rust:        29ms total
```

**Winner: Rust** - Most efficient execution

---

## Key Observations

### Rust üèÜ
- **Pros:**
  - Smallest executable (1.5 MB)
  - Fastest startup (29ms)
  - Fastest execution (29ms total)
  - Excellent type safety
  - Zero garbage collection overhead
  - Feature-complete with proper DOM manipulation (kuchiki)

- **Cons:**
  - Steepest learning curve
  - Longest compilation time (14s incremental, 33s clean build)
  - Borrow checker complexity

### Go ü•á
- **Pros:**
  - Fastest compilation (2s)
  - Simplest syntax (lowest barrier)
  - Good performance (42ms startup)
  - Goroutines for concurrency

- **Cons:**
  - Larger binary than Rust (6.2 MB)
  - HTML parsing library less robust
  - Error handling verbose

### C# (.NET) ü•à
- **Pros:**
  - Feature-complete, production-ready implementation
  - Excellent HTML parsing (AngleSharp)
  - Excellent async/await patterns
  - Rich .NET ecosystem

- **Cons:**
  - Larger binary (5.4 MB AOT)
  - Slower startup (56ms)
  - Requires Visual Studio Build Tools for AOT
  - More complex build pipeline

---

## Recommendation

**For Production:** Rust or C# (.NET) - Both feature-complete, Rust has better performance

**For Performance:** Rust - Smallest (1.5MB), fastest (29ms), most efficient

**For Rapid Development:** Go - Quick iteration (2s build), simple syntax, good performance

**For Scripting/CLI Tool:** Rust - Self-contained, no dependencies, excellent performance

## Build Instructions

### C# (.NET)
```powershell
cd . && powershell -Command "& '.\publish.ps1'"
```

### Go
```bash
cd go && go build -o sitecompiler-go.exe
```

### Rust
```bash
cd rust && cargo build --release
```
